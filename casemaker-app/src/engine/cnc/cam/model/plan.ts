/**
 * cam/model/plan.ts — the one entry point of the model-driven CAM engine (#956). §3.0/§3.0.1 of
 * `docs/design/cam-model-engine.md` is this file's source of truth; read that before changing
 * anything here.
 *
 * `planModelCam` replaces both `generateSurface3dForGoal` and `generateSurface3dIR` at their
 * `generateGoalPrograms`/`generateSurfacePrimitiveProgram` call sites — both already `async`, so
 * this is not a new calling convention for either caller. It is wired behind an opt-in flag
 * (`USE_MODEL_CAM_ENGINE`, set only by specs for now) so nothing changes for an operator until
 * #957/#959/#960 land for real; every stub below throws, so a run with the flag on fails loudly
 * instead of posting an empty program.
 *
 * The PUBLIC output types below (`OpOutcome`, `RegionAtZ`, `RegionRef`, `PassRef`, `PlannedOp`,
 * `Polygon`, `Box2`, and this file's OWN `CycleCost`) are distinct from `linking.ts`'s and
 * `sequence.ts`'s internal shapes: those two modules are C's real #961/#962 implementations, with
 * their own richer internal types (`SequenceStep`/`CandidateSequence`/a DIFFERENT, internal
 * `CycleCost` in `sequence.ts` that sums to a bare `estimateSeconds: number`; `LinkPoint`/
 * `MaterialField`/`PassLink` in `linking.ts`). `planModelCam` is the adapter between C's internal
 * shapes and this serialisable `SetupPlan` — the surface F's parity harness (`modelGolden.spec.ts`)
 * and D's panel read, and the one this file's own `CycleCost` is shaped to match exactly.
